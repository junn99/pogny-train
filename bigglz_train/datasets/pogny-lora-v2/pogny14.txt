Pogny a white teddy bear with a pink heart on its chest, crying. Its fur is soft and fluffy, and its eyes are closed in a sad expression. Its ears are perked up and its mouth is slightly open, as if it is in a state of distress. The heart is a bright pink color, adding a cheerful touch to the image.
